# multi-agent-reinforcement-learning-using-group-decision-making-method

this code is a method using GMD in MARL
including four part  
#### 1. GDM  
include GDM.py Model.py  
This part use Group Decision Making method to simulate multi-agent decision making, in order to make use the experiement of human society decision making to build the agent system.
#### 2. Maze  
include coop_env.py maze.py maze_env2.py  
the environment maze_env2 is built by TKinter. we recode this maze from morvan. 
#### 3. DRL  
include test.py train.py RL_brain.py  
we recode the DQN from morvan.  
We use tensorflow to build the reinforcement learning model.
#### 4. API  
include API.py
